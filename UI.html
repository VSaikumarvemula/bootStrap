                    <h2>About Html</h2>
                    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, 
                    is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
                     Itâ€™s a combination of Hypertext, which defines the link between web pages,
                      and Markup language, which is used to define the text document within tags 
                      to structure web pages. This language is used to annotate text so that machines 
                      can understand and manipulate it accordingly. HTML is human-readable and uses tags
                       to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. This guide will help you understand
                        the workings of HTML and explain it with examples.</p>

                <p>Microservices are an architectural approach to developing software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Instead of building a monolithic application where all the functionality is tightly integrated into a single codebase, microservices break down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services
